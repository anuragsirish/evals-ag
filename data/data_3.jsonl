In contrast, arrangements or transactions related to cargo freight – including any compartments or facilities used solely for the transport of commercial cargo – are not covered by this exemption.\nIn other words, because cargo freight shipments (or “parts” thereof) do not fall into the category of matters incident to personal travel, they do not benefit from the travel exemption provided under these regulations.

{"query": "are Interline Ticketing and Baggage and Special Prorate Agreements exempt under the travel exemption?", "context": "", "response": "Yes. According to [Case No. IA-16194], U.S. airlines generally may rely on the travel exemption to enter into interline ticketing and baggage (ITB) and special prorate agreements (SPAs) with Iranian airlines—provided the agreements are directly incident to arranging or facilitating international travel to or from Iran. [Case No. IA-16194] explains that while the Iranian Transactions Regulations impose broad prohibitions on transactions with Iranian goods or services, the exemption in § 560.210(d) covers transactions ordinarily incident to travel. In this context, interline ticketing and prorate agreements are considered part of travel arrangements, as long as they are confined to facilitating travel.\nThe guidance in [Case No. IA-16194] also emphasizes that to determine exemption status, additional details must be provided about the specific nature of the ITB and SPA agreements—such as whether the agreements include components that fall outside the direct facilitation of travel. Moreover, the exemption does not apply to entities designated under the Global Terrorism Sanctions Regulations (GTSR).\nSummary:\n• If the agreement is strictly limited to activities directly incident to travel (ticketing, baggage transfer, fare proration), it is exempt.\n• If it includes non-travel components or involves designated counterparties, it is not.\nThis analysis is based on [Case No. IA-16194].", "ground_truth": "Yes.
