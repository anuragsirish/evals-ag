In contrast, arrangements or transactions related to cargo freight – including any compartments or facilities used solely for the transport of commercial cargo – are not covered by this exemption. In other words, because cargo freight shipments (or \\\"parts\\\" thereof) do not fall into the category of matters incident to personal travel, they do not benefit from the travel exemption provided under these regulations. None of the documents indicate that any commercial cargo freight or compartments used for it are treated as \\\"accompanied baggage\\\" or otherwise incident to travel for personal use. The commentary accompanying these provisions further reinforces that the travel exemption is intended solely for travel-related transactions (whether for accompanied baggage or for travel arrangements), not for the exportation of goods or commercial freight services.\"\n",

    "    response=\"Yes. According to [Case No. IA-16194], U.S. airlines generally may rely on the travel exemption to enter into interline ticketing and baggage (ITB) and special prorate agreements (SPAs) with Iranian airlines—provided the agreements are directly incident to arranging or facilitating international travel to or from Iran. [Case No. IA-16194] explains that while the Iranian Transactions Regulations impose broad prohibitions on transactions with Iranian goods or services, the exemption in § 560.210(d) covers transactions ordinarily incident to travel. In this context, interline ticketing and prorate agreements are considered part of travel arrangements, as long as they are confined to facilitating travel. The guidance in [Case No. IA-16194] also emphasizes that in order to fully determine exemption status, additional details must be provided about the specific nature of the ITB and SPA agreements—such as whether the agreements include any components (for example, ancillary goods or services) that may fall outside the direct facilitation of travel. Moreover, it is noted that the exemption does not apply to entities designated under the Global Terrorism Sanctions Regulations (GTSR) (see commentary in [Case No. IA-16194]), so if any counterparties are so designated, the exemption would not apply. In summary, for U.S. airlines: • If an interline ticketing and baggage or special prorate agreement is strictly limited to activities directly incident to international travel (e.g., issuing tickets, coordinating baggage transfer, or proration of travel fares), then such transactions are exempt under the travel exemption. • If the agreements include additional non–travel-related components or involve counterparties designated under certain sanctions (such as under the GTSR), then the exemption may not apply. This analysis is based on the information and guidance provided in [Case No. IA-16194].\"\n",

[Case No. IA-16194] explains that while the Iranian Transactions Regulations impose broad prohibitions on transactions with Iranian goods or services, the exemption in § 560.210(d) covers transactions ordinarily incident to travel. In this context, interline ticketing and prorate agreements are considered part of travel arrangements, as long as they are confined to facilitating travel.\\nThe guidance in [Case No. IA-16194] also emphasizes that to determine exemption status, additional details must be provided about the specific nature of the ITB and SPA agreements—such as whether the agreements include components that fall outside the direct facilitation of travel. Moreover, the exemption does not apply to entities designated under the Global Terrorism Sanctions Regulations (GTSR).\\nSummary:\\n• If the agreement is strictly limited to activities directly incident to travel (ticketing, baggage transfer, fare proration), it is exempt.\\n• If it includes non-travel components or involves designated counterparties, it is not.\\nThis analysis is based on [Case No. IA-16194].</td>\n",

Broadcasting a pre-existing, “copy-ready” advertisement on behalf of a sanctioned person can fall within the informational-materials exemption. [FAC No. CU-156123] states that a U.S. radio station’s dissemination of an unaltered commercial audio tape for a Cuban national was exempt. Related rulings (e.g., 031211-FACRL-IA-14) confirm that if the ad is fully created before transmission and the U.S. broadcaster merely disseminates it—without creative modification or additional marketing services—it is exempt. If the broadcaster adds creative or consulting services, a license would be required.\\nThus, mere dissemination of a pre-existing advertisement is generally permitted; additional marketing services are not.   \n",

[Case No. IA-2018-355540-1] explains that importation of Iranian-origin goods is generally prohibited, but demonetized (no-longer-valid) banknotes may qualify as informational materials. Importation or exportation of such demonetized notes can be exempt. If the notes are still valid currency, or if the transaction is wholly domestic within the U.S., a specific license is required. Thus, only demonetized notes moved across borders under the informational-materials exemption can be imported without a license; valid currency or purely domestic transactions require OFAC authorization.   \n",

In contrast, arrangements or transactions related to cargo freight – including any compartments or facilities used solely for the transport of commercial cargo – are not covered by this exemption.In other words, because cargo freight shipments (or “parts” thereof) do not fall into the category of matters incident to personal travel, they do not benefit from the travel exemption provided under these regulations. None of the documents indicate that any commercial cargo freight or compartments used for it are treated as “accompanied baggage” or otherwise incident to travel for personal use.The commentary accompanying these provisions further reinforces that the travel exemption is intended solely for travel-related transactions (whether for accompanied baggage or for travel arrangements), not for the exportation of goods or commercial freight services..\"\n",

According to [Case No. IA-16194], U.S. airlines generally may rely on the travel exemption to enter into interline ticketing and baggage (ITB) and special prorate agreements (SPAs) with Iranian airlines—provided the agreements are directly incident to arranging or facilitating international travel to or from Iran. [Case No. IA-16194] explains that while the Iranian Transactions Regulations impose broad prohibitions on transactions with Iranian goods or services, the exemption in § 560.210(d) covers transactions ordinarily incident to travel. In this context, interline ticketing and prorate agreements are considered part of travel arrangements, as long as they are confined to facilitating travel. The guidance in [Case No. IA-16194] also emphasizes that in order to fully determine exemption status, additional details must be provided about the specific nature of the ITB and SPA agreements—such as whether the agreements include any components (for example, ancillary goods or services) that may fall outside the direct facilitation of travel. Moreover, it is noted that the exemption does not apply to entities designated under the Global Terrorism Sanctions Regulations (GTSR) (see commentary in [Case No. IA-16194]), so if any counterparties are so designated, the exemption would not apply. In summary, for U.S. airlines: • If an interline ticketing and baggage or special prorate agreement is strictly limited to activities directly incident to international travel (e.g., issuing tickets, coordinating baggage transfer, or proration of travel fares), then such transactions are exempt under the travel exemption. • If the agreements include additional non–travel-related components or involve counterparties designated under certain sanctions (such as under the GTSR), then the exemption may not apply. This analysis is based on the information and guidance provided in [Case No. IA-16194].\"\n",

According to [Case No. IA-2012-293259-1], providing access to a subscription database of legal information can be exempt under the informational-materials exemption—provided the content is fully created and in existence at the time of transmission and is not created or altered at the behest of a sanctioned person. [Case No. MUL-2012-298067-1] further clarifies that commercial subscriptions to pre-existing legal content qualify as exempt if no prohibited alterations occur.\\nIn summary, subscription access to a database of pre-existing legal materials is exempt so long as the materials are not newly created or modified for a sanctioned person.   \n",

Broadcasting a pre-existing, “copy-ready” advertisement on behalf of a sanctioned person can fall within the informational-materials exemption. [FAC No. CU-156123] states that a U.S. radio station’s dissemination of an unaltered commercial audio tape for a Cuban national was exempt. Related rulings (e.g., 031211-FACRL-IA-14) confirm that if the ad is fully created before transmission and the U.S. broadcaster merely disseminates it—without creative modification or additional marketing services—it is exempt. If the broadcaster adds creative or consulting services, a license would be required.\\nThus, mere dissemination of a pre-existing advertisement is generally permitted; additional marketing services are not.   \n",

Under 31 CFR § 579.305, artworks classified under HTSUS headings 9701, 9702, or 9703 are “informational materials.” Sculptures (heading 9703) therefore qualify. [Case No. IA-17159] and the decision in United States v. Three Burmese Statues confirm that original sculptures meet the criteria if fully created at the time of the transaction. Hence, sculptures are informational materials when properly classified.   \n",

[Case No. IA-2018-355540-1] explains that importation of Iranian-origin goods is generally prohibited, but demonetized (no-longer-valid) banknotes may qualify as informational materials. Importation or exportation of such demonetized notes can be exempt. If the notes are still valid currency, or if the transaction is wholly domestic within the U.S., a specific license is required. Thus, only demonetized notes moved across borders under the informational-materials exemption can be imported without a license; valid currency or purely domestic transactions require OFAC authorization.   \n",
